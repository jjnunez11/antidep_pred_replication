Thank you for your interest in our project! Our aim is to make it as reproducible as possible, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

## Correction
On behalf of the authors, we would like to let readers know that some minor bugs were found in our computer code after publication. 
These have not changed the general understanding of our paper, but have affected most of the reported results, generally decreasing our results by a small amount. 
We have contacted the journal regarding this error and its correction. All authors have approved these corrections.

Please see the [correction folder](./correction) for our corrected manuscript, corrected results, corrected supplementary results, and a description of the correction.

The code in this github repository has been corrected to address these bugs. 

## Data Availability
The raw clinical data from STAR*D is found [in our NIMH NDA project collection](http://dx.doi.org/10.15154/1503299)

You can download the data freshly from NDA via the measures tab, or can download a zip of the exact data we used going to the "Data Analysis" tab
and downloading the file [Version Of Raw Data Used with One Modification] https://nda.nih.gov/study.html?tab=result&id=640. 

The raw clinical data from CAN-BIND-1 can obtained from [Brian-CODE](https://braininstitute.ca/research-data-sharing/brain-code)

The processed STAR*D datasets used directly for machine learning are obtainable through our NIMH NDA project, in the data analysis tab,
and is named [Processed STARD Datasets used for ML](https://nda.nih.gov/study.html?tab=result&id=640)

The processed CAN-BIND datasets used directly for machine learning are obtainable through [Brian-CODE](https://braininstitute.ca/research-data-sharing/brain-code).
We may update the NDA collection with them when possible.

The exact models objects used to obtain our results, compressed via Python's pickle protocol, are obtain in this [OneDrive folder](https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=3270DE108C079AD9&resid=3270DE108C079AD9%2113381&authkey=AGH3p3NQb5bCa9w) due to space constraints of Github. 

The non-corrected results initially used in our paper are located within zips for each table in the [previous results folder](./previous results)

## Data Processing

Please find our data cleaning and processing code in [data-cleaning](./code/data-cleaning/)

The raw STAR*D and CAN-BIND data should be placed in separate folders within [data](./data/)

### Run order
1. Generate STAR*D dataset with [stard_preprocessor.py](./code/data-cleaning/stard_preprocessor.py)
2. Generate initial CAN-BIND dataset with  [canbind_preprocessor.py](./code/data-cleaning/canbind_preprocessor.py)
3. Generate overlapping datasets with [generate_overlapping_features](./code/data-cleaning/generate_overlapping_features.py)

## Running Machine Learning Analysis
1. Update the path of your data and result directories in [run_globals](./code/run_globals.py)
2. If using the preprocessing scripts above, the final data matrices will be saved within ./processed_data/final_xy_data_matrices/
3. Place your .csv files with the X and y matrices you want to run (or ours as downloaded) into the data directory above
4. Run the machine learning with [run_results](./code/run_results.py) script. This script calls [run_result](./code/run_results.py), assuming the filename of the 
dataset csv's will be passed along, minus the '.csv' ending. 

### Code Versions
The project's code was last completely ran in October, 2020. The following versions were used:
Python 3.6.10
scikit-learn 0.23.1
pandas 1.0.5
numpy 1.17.0
scipy 1.5.0

### Correction

After publication, some bugs were found in our code. These have been corrected and merged to Master. As well, in this directory there is a corrected version of our manuscript, to see changes via Track Changes. The general results and understanding of our paper did not change, most results decreased by a small amount after fixing the bugs.
